# HyperGraph Toolkit 

## Overview
The HyperGraph toolkit is Python 3 module developed to support the use of hypernetworks, hypergraphs and Q-analysis for research in language, complex event detection and artificial intelligence. 

The toolkit provides methods for collecting text data from open media sources such as websites, RSS, and wikipedia. There are also some tools for accessing twitter data, yelp and Facebook. 

The Spacy.io NLP framework provides options for natural language processing. The toolkit provides additional methods built on spacy for generating representations for language classification and topic analysis. 

New features include a multi-criteria decision analysis algorithm that uses Q-analysis to rank preferences given a mapping between a weighted input vector and decision space (representation).

Current work is focused on ideological profiling to predict voting and consumer behavior. Additional work is being carried out to study infrastructure planning impacts on property values.

## Background
Improvements in computational processing speed has unleashed a flood of research into  the application of topology to a range of complex, n-dimensional systems problems. This has lead to major breakthroughs in medical diagnostics, computer graphics, decision-science, systems design, and artificial intelligence. Despite a growing body of research stretching back to the 1930s, there are surprisingly few computing frameworks that specifically support topological data analysis (TDA). 

**HyperGraph** is a lightweight, experimental computing framework that implements a polyhedral dynamics approach to the study of ontological assemblages and artifical intelligence. In particular, HyperGraph provides a software implementation of Johnson's hypernetwork theory (Johnson 2014; 2016) and Atkin's Q-analysis (Atkin 1974; 1977). HyperGraphâ€™s use of simplicial families and complexes, makes it suitable as a general computing framework for studying a diverse set of complex systems, including natural language. 

HyperGraph has already been used for automated ontology generation, text classification and sentiment analysis, and it is being extended as a 'smart' complex event detection system to monitor disaster events (and risk) around the world. More recent use has shown particular value of the toolkit for constructing ideological profiles based on language use around a given policy topic or social issue in popular media.

## Current Version v.001
HyperGraph was built using [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org), [Cython 0.20](http://cython.org/), and tested on Mac and Windows based operating systems. Additional documentation is forthcoming that will describe basic usage of the software.
